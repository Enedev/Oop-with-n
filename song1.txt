It almost feels
Like it was just a dream
All these memories of you and me
Blown away
In the summer breeze
It almost feels like
We just never were
All this time we spent was just a blur
Now it's just me and a melody
So what am I
Supposed to do
'Cause all these plans
We made in the sand
Are through
Without you
I'm on my own
Am I'm gonna be alone
And if it's only
Me, myself and I
Will I be fine?
So far from home
And I just don't know
Am I gonna make it
Brave enough to
Take this road
Out on my own
Looking in the mirrors odyssey
All these choices that I'm caught between
Who I should and who I wanna be
I wanna stand and take this wave
And ride into a brighter day
I'll take each chance and better me
I think that I know what to do
I got all these plans, I'm a one man band it's true
Now I can't lose
Out on my own
Never gonna be alone
As long as I got me, myself and I
I'm doing fine
So far from home
I just don't know
Am I gonna make it
Brave enough to take this road?
Out on my own
Oh oh
Out on my own
Oh oh
Out on my own
And maybe I'm falling on my face
Or maybe I'm landing in my place
And maybe we're a million miles apart
Or maybe we're standing heart to heart
But no matter what
I'm walking
Right off this stage
And never looking back
Looking back to yesterday
No, way
No, way...
I'm on my own!
I'm on my own
Never gonna be alone
As long as I got
Me, myself and I
I'm doing fine
So far from home
But now I know that
I am gonna make it
Brave enough to take this road
Out on my own
Oh oh
Out on my own
Oh oh
Out on my own
It almost feels
Like it was just a dream
All these memories of you and me
